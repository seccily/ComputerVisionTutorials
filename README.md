# ComputerVisionTutorials
This repo contains lab notebooks I prepared for the Computer Vision course at SabancÄ± University, which provides a comprehensive introduction to computer vision.

P.S. I didn't plan on sharing these notebooks when I was preparing them. For this reason, some of them don't have references. However, if you notice any references, please let me know so I can add them :)
